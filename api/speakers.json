At this time he started working with Java technology and has spent time working both in Java technology development and consultancy.

Adding lambda expressions to the language opens up a host of new expressive opportunities for applications and libraries.  You might assume that lambda expressions are simply a more syntactically compact form of inner classes, but, in fact, the implementation of lambda expressions is substantially different and builds on the invokedynamic feature added in Java SE 7.  \n\nThis session will explain the ideas behind lambda expressions, how they will be used in Java SE 8 and look at some of the details of their implementation.",

This has profound effects on how programs are constructed and transforms the way we can reason about them, test them, compose them, and deploy them into concurrent environments.\n\nBut what is the immutability story in Java? Is immutability just a Clojure or a functional thing, or does it apply to the type of OO programs we build with Java? If we do want to utilize immutable data in Java, how should we go about it? What built-in APIs can we use and what should we stay away from? What libraries are there to help us? How should we construct our programs - in the small and in the large?\n\nThis talk surveys the current state of immutable data in Java, comparing and contrasting it to Clojure",
